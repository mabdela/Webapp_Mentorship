<b>SHALEE Project: MentorRock</b>

Introduction and About:
---------------------

Currently there are many online workshops for specific topics or fields, but all of them are just one session for one course, and instructors have few interactions with students when the course is over. (Suppose that Piazza is a prime example of this) However, it is commonly the case that students have confusions and questions which they could seek advice from mentors, such as choosing a major or doing job searches. We believe such issue could be better addressed by building up long-term mentorship relations between people based on either a certain academic field or extracurricular interests. Therefore, we create this web app to achieve such goal.
	
The main purpose of our web application is building long-term mentorship, focusing mainly on mentor and mentee interactions. Mentors will accept up to a limited number of mentees, create one-to-one chat sessions with each of them based on a certain course or a common point of interest. Mentees will establish a connection with a mentor by sending the mentor a request, once accepted, a connection is set up, and a unique one-to-one chat session with the mentor will be set up. User can search for mentors they are interested in by topic of interests. This application is primarily targeting university students pursuing undergraduate degree and above, as well as teachers. The users are able to view their own and other usersâ€™ profiles; and are able to see the list of connections they have.
